# Chicago-Crime-2001-2023

The goal of this project is to answer the following questions:
-What are the top 3 crimes with arrests made in each year (2001-2021)?
-Which month generally has the greatest number of reported incidents?
-Which categories of crime have the greatest percent increase from 2021-2022?

The dataset is available from: https://data.cityofchicago.org

Description from source:
This dataset reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to present, minus the most recent seven days. Data is extracted from the Chicago Police Department's CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. In order to protect the privacy of crime victims, addresses are shown at the block level only and specific locations are not identified. This data includes unverified reports supplied to the Police Department. The preliminary crime classifications may be changed at a later date based upon additional investigation and there is always the possibility of mechanical or human error. Therefore, the Chicago Police Department does not guarantee (either expressed or implied) the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or correct sequencing of the information and the information should not be used for comparison purposes over time.

All queries were done in BigQuery.
