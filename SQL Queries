Exploring the Data

I created and ran all of my queries in BigQuery.

***What are the top 3 crimes with arrests made in each year (2001-2023)?



SELECT *,
FROM (SELECT year, primary_type, description, COUNT(*) AS num_of_incidents,
      ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY year ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS crime_rank
      FROM bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime
      WHERE arrest = TRUE
      GROUP BY year, primary_type, description
      ORDER BY year, num_of_incidents DESC, primary_type) AS t
WHERE crime_rank<=3;

***Which month generally has the greatest number of reported incidents?

SQL query

SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date) AS month, ROUND(COUNT(*)/COUNT(DISTINCT year)) AS avg_num_of_incidents
FROM bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime
WHERE year < 2023
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY avg_num_of_incidents DESC
LIMIT 1;
 
The month of July had the greatest number of reported incidents each year, averaging 32,586 incidents every July.
 
***Which categories of crime have the greatest percent increase from 2021-2022?
 
SELECT
  primary_type,description,
  COUNTIF(year = 2021) AS arrests_2021,
  COUNTIF(year = 2022) AS arrests_2022,
  ROUND((COUNTIF(year = 2022) - COUNTIF(year = 2021)) / COUNTIF(year = 2021)*100,2) AS pct_change_2021_to_2022
FROM bigquery-public-data.chicago_crime.crime
WHERE arrest = TRUE
  AND year IN (2021, 2022)
GROUP BY primary_type, description
HAVING COUNTIF(year = 2021) > 100
ORDER BY (COUNTIF(year = 2022) - COUNTIF(year = 2021)) / COUNTIF(year = 2021) DESC
